Who Are We?
-----------

The CyberGIS-Compute project is primarily run by the `CyberGIS Center <https://cybergis.illinois.edu/>`_. However, we are an open-source project and welcome contributions! `Click here to view our contributors <https://github.com/cybergis/cybergis-compute-python-sdk/graphs/contributors>`_.

Why?
----

For a brief overview, check out a recent paper on the project. A short excerpt explains our motiviation:

    Geospatial research and education have become increasingly dependent on cyberGIS to tackle computation and data challenges. However, the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure resources for geospatial research and education is extremely challenging due to both high learning curve for users and high software development and integration costs for developers, due to limited availability of middleware tools available to make such resources easily accessible. This tutorial describes CyberGIS-Compute as a middleware framework that addresses these challenges and provides access to high-performance resources through simple easy to use interfaces. The CyberGIS-Compute framework provides an easy to use application interface and a Python SDK to provide access to CyberGIS capabilities, allowing geospatial applications to easily scale and employ advanced cyberinfrastructure resources.
